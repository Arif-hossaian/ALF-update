Because all the Hindu artists who were there are almost gone. Abbasuddin and a handful of artists from his company moved to Dhaka. Along with that, Laila Arjumand Banu also came to Dhaka. The music world of Dhaka started with these few artists. Abdul Alim joined the publicity department of this company in 1948. In this context, Abdul Ahad said: One or two rural singers started coming from the village thinking that they had a new state and their own radio station. Abdul Majeed Talukdar and Darog Ali have to be named first. Abdul Majid used to sing very well. He had his own style of singing folk songs. He used to write songs himself.

Alim kept alive the village song which Abbasuddin once brought to the public, popularized it and spread it in the sky of this country.
