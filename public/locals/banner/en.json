Abdul Alim was born in extreme financial hardship. Neighbors and relatives were happy but his father could not be very happy due to financial strain. However, his mother, Khasa Bibi, took Abdul Alim's birth as a symbol of family progress. The mother thought that this boy was Paymant. By this one day this family's lack will be removed. Abdul Alim's father's name is Mohammad Isab Sheikh (Yusuf Sheikh). He depended on the small agricultural land he got from his forefather to support the family.
